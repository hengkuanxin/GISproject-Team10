**Classification**

It was very important that we understand the processes behind the different supervised classification methods, else it could affect the accuracy and findings greatly. In order to improve the classification accuracy, the training and test data sampled have to be representative of their land classes. This means that it is important to take good samples that are not ambiguous and have distinct signatures. Bad samples can affect the classification model greatly. This can be done by taking more smaller, targeted samples, rather than a single large sample (when selecting the regions of interest using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP).) Furthermore, training and test data must not intersect each other, or it could make the accuracy seem higher than it actually is.

Additionally, during the object-based image analysis using Orfeo Toolbox (OTB), the satellite images were segmented using the mean-shift algorithm. While this was a convenient method to segment the images, upon closer analysis the segmentation were not completely accurate, as some parts of roads and buildings could be clustered under the same segment. This could mean that some other clustering algorithm may have suited the image segmentation better. It is important to be aware of these details as we explore new plugins and methods.

**Remote Sensing**

Overall, the project was a great experience on trying out an actual use case. We have learnt that remote sensing using satellite imagery can be a powerful tool for humanitarian aid, as it can provide rapid and reliable information on the impact of a disaster and support the decision-making and planning of the response.

Learning these skills in the current world can be very beneficial, as remote sensing is becoming more accessible, affordable, and advanced with the development of new technologies, platforms, and data sources. Remote sensing can help us to monitor and understand the changes in the Earth's environment and climate, such as deforestation, glacier melting, and biodiversity loss, and detect and prevent the risks and impacts of natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, floods, droughts, and wildfires.

It can also be used to enhance the security and stability of regions and countries, such as by detecting illegal activities, conflicts, and human rights violations, and improve the quality of life and well-being of people, such as by providing access to information, education, health, and social services.

Remote sensing is a multidisciplinary field that requires the integration of knowledge and skills from various domains, such as geography, geology, physics, mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, and social sciences. Learning these skills can help us to develop our critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and communication abilities, which are essential for the future.
