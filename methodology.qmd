### 3.2 Data Wrangling

#### 3.2.1 Processing Raster Layers

Before we can proceed with the SCP Classification, we must first process the raster layers obtained from the satellite imagery sources. This is a necessary step as variation exists in terms of the area covered by the raster layers. For example, the Landsat 8, Landsat 9, and Sentinel-2 raster layers encompass a large area which extends beyond the boundaries of Derna, our focal area. Conversely, the Maxar raster layers require merging to cover the entirety of Derna. Therefore, processing the raster layers is a crucial preliminary step as it sets the foundation for a reliable and targeted dataset essential for effective SCP classification of Derna.

#### 3.2.1 Add Raster Layers

4.  Export the `01-07-2023 Merged` layer as a Rendered Image called `Natural Color (3-2-1)` and save it in the `01-07-2023 Clipped` folder.

#### 4.1.2 GeoEye-1 False Color Composite Image

False color composite image is commonly used for analyzing vegetation, monitoring soil and crops. Deep red indicates healthy and dense vegetation, while grassy or sparse/shrubby vegetation appears in lighter shades while urban areas are green-blue, and the soil color varies from dark to light brown.

Repeat the process in **Section 4.1.1** but using the following band combination:

-   For **Red** band select **Band 4**

#### 4.1.3 GeoEye-1 Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI)

The GNDVI is a vegetation index used to estimate photosynthetic activity, and is therefore helpful in understanding vegetation density and assessing changes in plant health (ArcGIS Pro, n.d.).

GNDVI is calculated as a ratio Near Infra-red (NIR) and Green (G) values as per the following equation:

GNDVI=((NIR - G))/((NIR +G))

Where:

**Green -- Band 2**

**NIR -- Band 4**

Click on the Processing Toolbox icon ![](images/Methodology/Picture45.png){width="27"}

1.  Search for "**Raster Calculator**" and open the tool

![](images/Methodology/Picture46.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  For Expression input the following:

`("01-07-2023 Merged@4"-"01-07-2023 Merged@2)/("01-07-2023 Merged@4"+"01-07-2023 Merged@2")`

-   For Reference layers use `01-07-2023 Merged`.

-   Click Run

![](images/Methodology/Picture52.png){fig-align="center"}

6.  Export the `Output` layer as a GeoTiff called `GNDVI` and save it in the `01-07-2023 Clipped` folder.

#### 4.1.4 GeoEye-1 Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI)

The RDVI is a vegetation index that assesses vegetation health. As floods can drastically affect soil conditions, this index is appropriate for use in our EDA as it is not affected by changes in soil conditions or the angle from which the vegetation is observed (NV5 Geospatial, n.d.), therefore making it more reliable for observing the effects of the flood on vegetation alone.

RDVI is calculated as a ratio of Near Infra-red (NIR) and Red (R) values as per the following equation:

RDVI=((NIR - R))/√((NIR + R))

Where:

**Red -- Band 3**

**NIR -- Band 4**

1.  Repeat the steps from **Section 4.1.3** however under '**Expression**' input:

`("01-07-2023 Merged@4"-"01-07-2023 Merged@3")/(("01-07-2023 Merged@4"+"01-07-2023 Merged@3"))^0.5`

2.  Adjust the Symbology according to the following:

-   Set Render type to Singleband pseudocolor

-   Color Ramp: Greens

-   Mode: Equal Interval

-   Classes: 4

You will get the following layer:

![](images/Methodology/Picture53.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  Export the `Output` layer as a GeoTiff called `RDVI` and save it in the `01-07-2023 Clipped` folder.

#### 4.1.5 GeoEye-1 Ferric Iron, 3+

The roots of plants absorb Iron (Fe) from the soil as either ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) ions. Fe is essential for healthy vegetation as it plays an essential role in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen-fixation as nitrogen-fixing bacteria use it for enzymatic reactions (The Fertilizer Institute, n.d.).

Fe^2+^/Fe^3+^ deficiency can cause a variety of problems for vegetation such as stunted growth, wilting and reduced yields (The Fertilizer Institute, n.d.).

Fe^3+^ is calculated as a ratio of Red(R) and Green (G) values as per the following equation:

Fe^3+^=R/G

Where:

**Red -- Band 3**

**Green -- Band 2**

1.  Repeat the steps from **Section 4.1.3** however under '**Expression**' input:

`("01-07-2023 Merged@3"/"01-07-2023 Merged@2")`

2.  Adjust the Symbology according to the following:

-   Set Render type to Singleband pseudocolor

-   Color Ramp: Cividis

-   Mode: Equal Interval

-   Classes: 4

You will get the following layer:

![](images/Methodology/Picture54.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  Export the `Output` layer as a GeoTiff called `Ferric Iron, Fe3+` and save it in the `01-07-2023 Clipped` folder.

Repeat the steps from **Sections 4.1.1 -- 4.1.4** for the `13-09-2023 Merged` raster layer. Save the new merged layers as `Natural Color (3-2-1)`, `False Color Composite (4-3-2)`, `GNDVI` and `RDVI` in the `13-09-2023 Clipped` folder.

-   For GNDVI use the following expression:

`("13-09-2023 Merged@4"-"13-09-2023 Merged@2)/("13-09-2023 Merged@4"+"13-09-2023 Merged@2")`

-   For RDVI use the following expression:

`("13-09-2023 Merged@4"-"13-09-2023 Merged@3")/(("13-09-2023 Merged@4"+"13-09-2023 Merged@3"))^0.5`

Using information provided in the '`readme.doc`', we can determine Derna's soil type:

-   **I:** Lithosol

-   **Bv:** Vertic Cambisols

-   **Lc:** Chromic Luvisols

-   **2/3ab:** dry soil that receives moisture for a short period of time.

The dominant soil type of Derna is Lithosols, while Vertic Cambisols and Chromic Luvisols are also present, but with less abundance.

## 5. Data Exploration of Composite Images

### 5.1 Composite Images

Prior to conducting the Land Use Land Cover Change (LULC) classification, it is vital that the composite images are examined to gain a better understanding of the land cover changes caused by the flood. This understanding will enable visual identification of errors without constantly needing to meticulously examine the quantifiable metrics.

#### 5.1.1 Natural Color Images

![**Figure 7:** Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-2 & GeoEye-1 Natural Color Images Before and After the Flood](images/Methodology/Picture97.png){fig-align="center"}

![**Figure 8:** GeoEye-1 Natural Color Images of the Flood Damage](images/Methodology/Picture98.png){fig-align="center"}

The pre-flood images in Figure 7, demonstrate that Derna is a coastal city bisected by a river, the Wadi Derna River, comprising dense patches of vegetation and a mountainous terrain. However, the post-flood photos in Figure 7 illustrate a scene of utter chaos and destruction as despite the floodwaters notably receding, it is evident that they are carrying a substantial amount of mud and debris, discernible through the color of the water. In addition, tremendous damage has been caused to Derna's essential infrastructure through the destruction of five major roads, a highway, and a port facility as depicted in Figure 8. In particular, the city center has been inundated with areas in close proximity to the Wadi Derna River appearing to have experienced the brunt of the devastation.

In addition, the visualisation of the damage is far easier to see in the GeoEye-1 imagery, followed by Sentinel-2 imagery, and lastly the Landsat 8/9 imagery. This can be attributed to GeoEye-1's close proximity (1.84m) to the target site, resulting in a higher image resolution.

#### 5.1.2 False Color Composite Images

![**Figure 9:** Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-2 & GeoEye-1 False Color Composite Images Before and After the Flood](images/Methodology/Picture99.png){fig-align="center"}

![**Figure 10:** GeoEye-1 False Color Composite Images of the Flood Damage](images/Methodology/Picture100.png){fig-align="center"}

The pre-flood images in Figures 9 and 10, depicts dense vegetation alongside the Wadi Derna river, with dense patches of farmlands scattered throughout the city of Derna. In addition, sparse variation can be observed throughout the city. However, the post-flood photos in Figures 9 and 10 illustrate a severe reduction of vegetation with a notable decrease in vegetation density alongside the Wadi Derna river with numerous plantations in the city being transformed into barren land after the flood.

#### 5.1.3 Geology Images

![**Figure 11:** Landsat 8/9 & Sentinel-2 Geology Images Before and After the Flood](images/Methodology/Picture101.png){fig-align="center"}

The pre-flood geological features of Derna in Figure 11 depicts a dense concentration of geological structures located away from the urban area, which is located along the coastline. The mountainous terrain exhibits a variety of geological characteristics, which is illustrated by the varying intensity of the yellow color. The post-flood images exhibit a more well-defined geological structure, indicating that the flood may have exposed underlying formations through erosion enabled by natural processes such as chemical weathering^1^.

^1^Chemical weathering refers to the chemical decomposition of rocks in situ by natural agents at the earth's surface which causes rocks to be weakened and land to be made more permeable, making it more susceptible to erosion.

#### 5.1.4 Moisture Index Images

![**Figure 12:** Landsat 8/9 & Sentinel-2 Geology Images Before and After the Flood](images/Methodology/Picture102.png){fig-align="center"}

The pre-flood Moisture Index in Figure 12 exhibits a relatively high water uptake in areas of dense vegetation which reveals that these regions were well-hydrated prior to the flood. However, the post-flood imagery illustrates a slightly increased water uptake in these regions, which indicates that the flood further saturated these regions.

#### 5.1.5 NDVI/GNDVI

![**Figure 13:** Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-2 & GeoEye-1 GNDVI Before and After the Flood](images/Methodology/Picture103.png){fig-align="center"}

The pre-flood GNDVI/NDVI illustrates good vegetation density and health. However, the post-flood GNDVI/NDVI indicates a severe reduction of vegetation, however, vegetation health remains mostly unchanged.

#### 5.1.6 RDVI

![**Figure 14:** GeoEye-1 RDVI Images Before and After the Flood](images/Methodology/Picture104.png){fig-align="center"}

The pre-flood RDVI in Figure 14 illustrates good vegetation health and dense vegetation is distributed across the city. However, the post-flood RDVI demonstrates a severe reduction in vegetation density and decline in vegetation health as illustrated by the white spots present. This indicates that the flood not only stripped away vegetation but also attributed towards reducing vegetation health.

Now that we have gained a better understanding of the land cover changes from **Sections 5.1.1 -- 5.1.6**, we are now ready to proceed with the Land Cover Classification, as outlined in **Section 5.2**.

### 5.2 Land Cover Classification (GeoEye-1)

#### 5.2.1 Land Cover Scheme

We will classify the land cover based on the following categories:

![](images/Methodology/Picture105.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Waterbody: sea, coastal water

2.  Bareland: Open land, rock

3.  Vegetation: Farmland, Natural Vegetation

4.  Built-up: Buildings, Residentials, Factories

5.  Impervious Surface: Roads, Concrete

6.  Cloud

7.  Shadow

#### 5.2.2 Selecting Training & Test Sets (Before Flood)

We will now create 2 sets of samples to be used to train and test our classification model. As the classification will require creating many ESRI shapefile files, we must ensure we practice good file management.

1.  Create a folder called `LULC`.

2.  Within `LULC`, create a sub-folder called `shapefile`.

3.  Inside `shapefile` create 3 sub-folders called `before_flood`, `after_flood`, and `classification`.

**Note**: it is very important that our folders' names **do not contain any spaces**; if you have any space in your folders' names, replace it with an underscore.

1.  Return to QGIS. From Layer \> Create Layer \> select New Shapefile Layer...

![](images/Methodology/Picture106.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  Fill in the details as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture107.png){fig-align="center"}

Note: save the new file under `shapefile > before_flood` as `sample_before`.

3.  Once done, click on OK and the new layer will be added to our project.

4.  Select on the layer and click on **toggle editing**, then click on the tool called **Add Point Feature**:

![](images/Methodology/Picture108.png){fig-align="center"}

We will now create a sample point on our map, referencing the multi-spectral composite layers `before the flood, 01-07-2023` we created earlier, such as the False Color Composite.

5.  Click on the following red point on the map and fill in the details as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture109.png){fig-align="center"}

This signifies that we have created a sample point at that location and given it a land cover class 1, referring to that of a waterbody in our land cover scheme.

6.  Repeat this step until we get a total of **50 sample points** **for each land cover class**. Since there are no clouds and shadows present before the flood, we can skip them for now.

You should have a total of 250 sample points representing a total of 5 different land cover classes, as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture110.png){fig-align="center"}

7.  Before we continue, repeat the steps to create another vector layer called `test_before`, and create a total of 250 test points, while ensuring that our test points do not overlap with the sample points, as shown below (in green):

![](images/Methodology/Picture111.png){fig-align="center"}

#### 5.2.3 Image Segmentation (Before Flood)

Now, we will segment the image using a clustering algorithm called "mean shift" to automatically identify objects present in the image.

1.  Click on the processing toolbox, and open the function called "**Segmentation**", and fill in the details as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture112.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture113.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  Scroll down and ensure we check the checkbox "**8-neighbor connectivity**".

![](images/Methodology/Picture114.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  Select output file and save it as a shapefile `segmentation_before.shp` under the folder `shapefile > before_flood`.

![](images/Methodology/Picture115.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  Leave all other options as their default values and click on run. This program might take a few minutes.

Once done, a the following vector layer will be added to the layers panel.

![](images/Methodology/Picture116.png){fig-align="center"}

5.  Next, open the processing tool called **ZonalStatistics**, and fill in the details as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture117.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture118.png){fig-align="center"}

6.  Ensure that you save the output file into the same folder, calling it `segmentation_stats_before.shp`. Click on Run.

Once done, we get a new layer as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture119.png){fig-align="center"}

7.  Open the attribute table of this layer, and we observe 4 sets of statistics, calculated from the 4 bands present in our GeoEye-1 data.

![](images/Methodology/Picture120.png){fig-align="center"}

8.  We will now use our sample set to select the segments (objects). Open the processing tool called **Join attributes by location** and fill in the details as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture121.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture122.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture123.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture124.png){fig-align="center"}

9.  Specify the output file as a shapefile called `sample_stats_before.shp` saved under the folder `shapefile> before_flood`. Click on Run.

Once done, we get a layer as follows, note that the sample points we created before are now covered by small segments.

![](images/Methodology/Picture125.png){fig-align="center"}

10. Repeat this step with the test samples, using `test_before` as the input file, and save the output as `test_stats_before.shp` under the folder `shapefile> before_flood`. Click on Run.

You will get the following result:

![](images/Methodology/Picture126.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture135.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  Save the output file as `SVM_classification_output_before.shp` under the folder `shapefiles > classification`. Once done, click on Run.

The output file is not automatically added to our project this time.

3.  Navigate to the classification output file and import it into our project. We get a layer as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture136.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  Navigate to properties of this layer, and select the options as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture137.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture138.png){fig-align="center"}

Categorised by the predicted value, there will be 5 different classes representing the land cover types defined earlier.

5.  Click on Apply, and you should get something like this:

![](images/Methodology/Picture139.png){fig-align="center"}

6.  Before continuing we must first dissolve the vector output so that all segments are grouped together by the land cover class. Select the vector tool and fill in the details as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture140.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture141.png){fig-align="center"}

7.  Save the output file as a GeoPackage, and name it `SVM_classification_output_before_dissolved`. Once done, click on Run.

We get a new layer as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture142.png){fig-align="center"}

8.  Repeat the steps and adjust the properties of the layer to get the following results:

![](images/Methodology/Picture143.png){fig-align="center"}

9.  Next, we will rasterize the layer. Open the tool Rasterize and fill in the details as shown:

11. Repeat the above steps to manipulate the properties of this layer.

You will get the following result:

![](images/Methodology/Picture147.png){fig-align="center"}

#### 5.2.6 Accuracy Assessment (Before Flood)

Finally, we will use the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) tool to calculate the accuracy of the classification.

1.  From SCP \> Postprocessing \> select **Accuracy**, and fill in the details as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture148.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture149.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  Click on Run. A dialog window pops up. Save the file as `SVM_classification_accuracy_before.tif` under the folder `shapefile > classification`.

![](images/Methodology/Picture150.png){fig-align="center"}

Once done, the program takes a few seconds to run and gives us the following output.

![](images/Methodology/Picture151.png){fig-align="center"}

The above result provides the area-based error matrix, as well as the overall accuracy and kappa hat value.

#### 5.2.7 Repeat the steps for another classification (After Flood)

Repeat the processes in **Sections 5.2.2 -- 5.2.7**, using the files from `13-09-2023 Clipped` to classify the satellite image taken after the flood. Save the files into `shapefile > after_flood` and `classification`.

You will get the following results:

3.  Once ready, click on Run. Save the output file under `shapefile > classification`, as `SVM_LULC_change.tif`. After a few seconds, the execution is complete, and we see a new raster layer added to our project:

![](images/Methodology/Picture159.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture160.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  Adjust the properties of the new layer as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture161.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture162.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture163.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture164.png){fig-align="center"}

5.  Click on Apply.

We have now highlighted the extent of damages of the flood caused to different land cover classes, as shown below:

![**Figure 14:** Highlighted Damages (in Area)](images/Methodology/Picture165.png){fig-align="center"}

### 5.3 Land Cover Classification (Sentinel-2)

#### 5.3.1 Selecting Regions of Interest for Training (Before Flood)

In this section, we will be creating a few other files separately. For good file management,

1.  Create a folder called `SCP` in the `LULC` folder.

2.  Next, create two sub-folders called `before_flood_sentinel` and `after_flood_sentinel` inside the `SCP` folder.

We will now classify the Sentinel-2 satellite images using the SCP Plugin.

Ensure you have the following layers present in your project:

-   `T34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B2_10m`

-   `T34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B3_10m`

-   `T34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B4_10m`

-   `T34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B8_10m`

1.  Open the **SCP tool**, and set these four bands into a new Band set, and set the wavelength quick settings as "Sentinel-2", as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture166.png){fig-align="center"}

In this case, set the following four bands into Band set 1.

2.  Next, close the dialog window, and navigate to the **SCP & Dock** panel:

![](images/Methodology/Picture167.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  Click on **Training Input** along the side of the panel, and click on the **icon with a yellow circle** to create a new training input:

![](images/Methodology/Picture168.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  A dialog window pops up. Save the file as `train_before.scp` under the folder `before_flood_sentinel`, as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture169.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture170.png){fig-align="center"}

Next, following our land cover scheme earlier, we will create a region of interest (ROI) representing the land cover of a waterbody.

5.  Fill in the **MC Name** and **C Name**, as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture171.png){fig-align="center"}

6.  Next, click on the following tool called Create a ROI polygon inside the SCP toolbar:

![](images/Methodology/Picture172.png){fig-align="center"}

7.  We will create a polygon in the waterbody, as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture173.png){fig-align="center"}

8.  Once done, click on the following icon to save the ROI's signature. This process will take a few seconds to execute.

![](images/Methodology/Picture174.png){fig-align="center"}

9.  Next, a saved signature appears in our signature list.

![](images/Methodology/Picture175.png){fig-align="center"}

10. Repeat the previous steps for a total of **5 samples for each land cover class for a total of 5 different land cover classes**, as shown in our land cover scheme. You should set the **MC ID to each match the land cover class**.

Waterbody will use 1 as the MCID, Bareland 2, Vegetation 3, and so on, as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture176.png){fig-align="center"}

Note that there are no clouds or shadows in the Sentinel-2 images. Therefore we will not include those classes.

Once complete, there will a total of 25 ROI, representing 5 different land cover classes, as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture177.png){fig-align="center"}

#### 5.3.2 Maximum Likelihood Classification (Before Flood)

Next, we will be classifying our satellite image using the calculated signatures of the ROIs that we have created.

1.  From SCP \> Band processing \> select Classification

![](images/Methodology/Picture178.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  Fill in the details as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture179.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  Once done, click on Run and save the output file as `ML_before_flood` under the folder `before_flood_sentinel`. The process will take a few seconds to run.

![](images/Methodology/Picture180.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  Once the process is complete, close the SCP window.

You will get the following result:

![](images/Methodology/Picture181.png){fig-align="center"}

5.  Adjust the properties of this new layer using the methods used earlier, such that the result looks like the following:

![](images/Methodology/Picture182.png){fig-align="center"}

**Note:** Maximum Likelihood gave us a more accurate result in this case, therefore it is preferred over the other methods.

#### 5.3.3 Selecting Regions of Interest for Testing (Before Flood)

We will repeat the previous section and create a set of ROIs to test our classification using the same band set. In our case, we are using band set 1.

1.  Same as before, create a new file called `test_before.scp` under the folder `before_flood_sentinel`.
2.  Create a total of **25 ROIs**, representing the **5 land cover classes**.

You will get the following result:

![](images/Methodology/Picture183.png){fig-align="center"}

#### 5.3.4 Accuracy Assessment (Before Flood)

Once we have completed our classification, we will now assess the accuracy to determine whether the classification is reliable and can be used to detect land cover change.

1.  From SCP \> Postprocessing \> select **Accuracy**, as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture148.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  Fill in the details as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture184.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  Once done, click on Run, and save your output file as `ML_accuracy_before_flood` under the folder `before_flood_sentinel` as shown below:

![](images/Methodology/Picture185.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  Upon completion, the program will execute.

You will receive the following result:

![](images/Methodology/Picture186.png){fig-align="center"}

Based on the result, we are able to see the area-based error matrix, as well as the overall accuracy and kappa hat value of the classification.

#### 5.3.5 Maximum Likelihood Classification (After Flood)

Repeat the steps above to classify the Sentinel-2 satellite images taken after the flood.

Ensure you have the following layers in your project:

-   `T34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B2_10m`

-   `T34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B3_10m`

-   `T34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B4_10m`

-   `T34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B8_10m`

1.  Next, add them into a new band set, for example, Band set 2.
2.  Create the ROIs for Train and Test, naming the files as `train_after.scp` and `test_after.scp` respectively, saving them into the folder `after_flood_sentinel`.
3.  Perform maximum likelihood classification, saving your file as `ML_after_flood` under the folder `after_flood_sentinel`.
4.  Assess the accuracy of the classification.

#### 5.3.6 Land Cover Change Detection

Once the two classifications are ready, we will use the SCP tool to determine the changes before and after the flood.

1.  Select the **Land cover change** tool of the SCP plugin (as shown in previous sections) and fill in the details as shown:

![](images/Methodology/Picture187.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  Click on Run and save the output as `ML_LULC_sentinel` under the folder `SCP`. The output is shown as follows, with a new layer added to our project:

![](images/Methodology/Picture188.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture189.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  Same as what we did before during the classification of GeoEye-1 images, adjust the properties of the new layer such that it appears as follows:

![](images/Methodology/Picture190.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture191.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture192.png){fig-align="center"}

![](images/Methodology/Picture193.png){fig-align="center"}

### 5.4 Land Cover Classification (Landsat 8/9)

Repeat the steps in **Section 5.3** for the classification of the Landsat 8/9 satellite images before and after the flood.

1.  Create 2 new sub-folders called `before_flood_landsat` and `after_flood_landsat` under the folder `SCP`.

2.  Ensure that you have the following layers in your project:

-   LC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B1

-   LC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B2

-   LC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B3

-   LC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B4

-   LC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B5

-   LC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B6

3.  Next, add the layers into a new band set, such as Band set 3.

4.  Create the ROIs for Train and Test, naming the files as `train_before.scp` and `test_before.scp` respectively, saving them into the folder `before_flood_landsat`.

5.  Perform random forest classification, saving your file as `RF_before_flood` under the folder `before_flood_landsat`.

**Note:** As Random Forest provided a more accurate result for this scenario, it is preferred over the other methods.

6.  Assess the accuracy of the classification.

Once the classification for the Landsat 8 images before the flood is complete, repeat the steps for the classification for the Landsat 9 images after the flood, using the following layers:

-   LC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B1

-   LC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B2

-   LC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B3

-   LC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B4

-   LC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B5

-   LC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B6

The results of the classification are shown below:

![Classification Before Flood (Landsat)](images/Methodology/Picture194.png){fig-align="center"}

![Classification After Flood (Landsat)](images/Methodology/Picture195.png){fig-align="center"}

As the resolution of the Landsat 8/9 satellite images are too coarse to clearly identify some land covers such as the roads (Impervious Surface), which are narrow and long, it indicates that classifications using Landsat 8/9 satellite images are not as useful as other satellite imagery to detect land cover changes. Therefore, we will be omitting the Landsat 8/9 satellite images from our final analysis.
