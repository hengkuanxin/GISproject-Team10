### 6. Analysis of the Results

As the Waterbody and Bareland categories do not directly reflect the damage caused by the flood, they will be excluded from the analysis.

![**Figure 16:** Percentage of Land Cover Change per Classification Category](images/Results/Picture196.png){fig-align="center"}

#### 0.855 km² of vegetation was turned into bare land or a water body.

The loss of vegetation carries severe environmental consequences as it could disrupt the entire ecosystem of the city.

Vegetation acts as producers: autotrophs of a food chain, as they produce their own food through photosynthesis (Rutledge, 2023). Therefore, a loss of producers directly impacts herbivores, primary consumers within the ecosystem, by limiting their food supply (Rutledge, 2023). Due to starvation and intensified competition for increasingly scarce sources of resources, this scarcity can lead to a population decline. Moreover, this disruption will have a ripple effect affecting secondary consumers that are preyed upon by primary consumers as well as subsequent levels of the food chain (Rutledge, 2023). There may also be a shortage of food for the human population dependent on agricultural products or livestock.

In addition, the lack of vegetation makes the area more susceptible to natural disasters such as flooding and soil erosion. Due to the important role played by trees in regulating water flows and minimising surface runoff, barren landscapes are more prone to flooding (Pachamama Alliance, n.d.). In addition, exposure to bare soils is increasing the risk of soil erosion both by wind and water that leads to loss of fertile topsoil which reduces crop production capacity  (Pachamama Alliance, n.d.), further posing a severe threat to food security.

#### 1.01 km² of built-up land was turned into bare land or a water body.

Aid efforts would be significantly hampered by the adverse impact of floods on vital infrastructure, including educational and healthcare facilities, as they make access to essential services and emergency accommodation difficult for those affected. Moreover, damage to housing and education facilities has a lasting impact which may lead to infrastructure damage, displacement of inhabitants, economic losses as a result of property damage.

Moreover, the damage to buildings and education facilities will have far reaching consequences for infrastructure damages, displacements of citizens, loss of income as a result of property damage.

#### 0.600 km² of impervious surface was turned into bare land or a water body.

The floods also caused extensive damage to the impermeable surfaces, turning approximately 0.600 km2 of land into wasteland or water bodies. This is accompanied by the destruction of five roads which connect East and West Derna, creating a physical barrier to transport and communication between these two regions. Furthermore, the destruction of these roads severely impedes the distribution of aid and relief efforts, which could potentially exacerbate the death toll.

Figure 18 unveils the extensive reach of the flood, inundating and destroying a significant proportion of infrastructure and vegetation that has been concentrated along the river's downstream path towards the northern coast. Furthermore, the brunt of the damage was inflicted on impervious surfaces along the coastline. The damage runs from the shore of the river down to the coast of the north, with other pockets of destruction throughout the city and mountain areas.

### 7. Recommendations

#### 7.1 Soft Engineering Strategies -- Prioritise Reforestation & Greening Efforts

According to the analysis of the soil composition carried out under **Section** **4.4**, Derna has a mixed soil composition with lithosols, also known as skeletal soils or shallow soils, as the dominant soil type. Furthermore, the soil types present in the city include Chromic Luvisol as well as Vertic Cambisols with smaller amounts.

Soft Engineering strategies are an intangible approach to prevent the immediate effects of floods and reduce post-flood issues. The most effective of these strategies is reforestation and greening with a view to preventing flooding while simultaneously reducing their (Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2017). In order to prevent the flow of water into rivers and floodplains, strategic planting of vegetation alongside rivers and floodplains can significantly reduce surface runoff (Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2017). This will allow for the release into the Derna River to be more controlled and sustained, thus limiting flooding. The fact that the cover of vegetation decreased significantly indicates a need for greater efforts to promote greening, as trees play an essential role in absorbing water and thereby reducing surface runoff. This phenomenon mitigates the consequences of floods in river basin areas, as well as at local level. Furthermore, planting vegetation could also reduce the consequences incurred by the loss highlighted in **Section** **6.1**.

The vegetation planted must be suitable for the soil type, as explored in **Section 7.1.1**.

#### **7.1.1** Shallow Soils -- Lithosols

Shallow soils (known in earlier soil classification systems as Lithosols) are highly erodible and tend to occur over steep slopes and mountainous regions (Osman, 2018). This type of soil is characterized by its lack of drainage and does not have much agricultural use due to the absence of iron (Fe) (Osman, 2018).

#### **7.1.2** Clay soils

Clay soils are distinguished for their nutrient-rich nature, particularly their high iron (Fe) content (The Royal Horticultural Society, n.d.) which enables high plant fertility. Moreover, soil resistance to compaction caused by plant roots allows plants to increase the uptake of essential nutrients (The Royal Horticultural Society, n.d.).

**1. Chromic Luvisols**

Luvisols are characterized by their high nutrient, such as iron, and clay content with predominantly good drainage. These characteristics make it suitable for a wide range of agricultural practices and vegetation (The editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2016). In addition, in climatic regimes ranging from cool temperate to warm Mediterranean, Luvisols are typically formed on flat or gently sloping terrain  (The editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2016).

**2. Vertic Cambisols**

Cambisols have a high iron content, even though they are much lower than Luvisol because of their smaller clay composition (Jordanova, 2017). Similar to Luvisols, Cambisols tend to form in flat or gently sloping landscapes under climate regimes ranging from cool temperate to warm Mediterranean (The editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2011).

#### 7.1.3 Most Suitable Vegetation Based on Soil Type

As the soil types vary across different regions of Derna, this has led to the question of whether it is appropriate to plant vegetation when soil types differ. As shown in Figure 19, because of their higher Fe content, clay soils Luvisols and Cambisols are more yellow on the map and appear to have a greater presence in low lying areas. In contrast, the shallow soils (Lithosols) appear bluer on the map and are more prevalent in steeper areas like hills due to the mountainous terrain of Derna.

For Luvisols and Cambisols, flood-resistant plants native to Derna, that grow best in clay-rich soil such the Tamarix aphylla and Typha domingensis (Fern, 2014) are the most suitable and cost-effective for flood mitigation. In contrast, the bluer, Lithosols favor the growth of succulent plants like the Artemisia Herba-Alba (Gazel, 2023) and Sea Orache (PlantIn, n.d.).

![**Figure 19:** GeoEye-1 Ferric Iron Composite Image](images/Results/Picture198.png){fig-align="center"}

### 7.2 Prioritising Flood Mitigation Efforts Based on Flood-Risk

The LULC detection demonstrates the extreme vulnerability of buildings and roads to flooding in Derna. In order to address this issue, city planners should put in place updated zoning codes limiting the construction of residential and essential infrastructure like water supply plants or sewage systems for flood affected areas. Policymakers implementing flood mitigation strategies should prioritise mitigation and evacuation strategies for the affected areas, emphasising heavily impacted zones and critical infrastructure like roads (depicted blue in Figure 18).

### 7.3 Investment in Insurance Policies

The road to recovery is often plagued with financial difficulties in the wake of such devastating floods. Economic losses may result from destruction of homes and businesses or infrastructure, meaning that individuals and societies must struggle to rebuild their lives. In such cases, an insurance policy may serve as a lifeline by providing financial assistance to help the affected people bridge the gap between prior circumstances and revitalisation of their livelihoods (Kagan, 2021).

Flood insurance may provide protection against the significant costs associated with the repair or replacement of flood damaged buildings and their contents for residents. The financial burden of building a new home can be very high, especially for people who have lost their homes and are experiencing other expenses such as transitional accommodation or relocation costs (Kagan, 2021). Flood risk insurance may provide the needed financial cushion, helping to rebuild residents' homes and restoring their sense of stability (Kagan, 2021), in the wake of such a tragedy.

Moreover, flood insurance can also benefit owners of businesses and other such infrastructures. Operations may be severely disrupted, and substantial financial losses may be incurred as a result of damage to buildings, equipment and other assets caused by floods (Kagan, 2021). In order to enable these undertakings to resume their activities more rapidly and reduce the financial impact of floods, flood insurance could assist them in paying for repairs and replacements (Kagan, 2021).

### 8. Future Work 

### 8.1 Lessons Learnt

#### 8.1.1 Classification Methods

It was very important that we understand the processes behind the different supervised classification methods, else it could affect the accuracy and findings greatly. In order to improve the classification accuracy, the training and test data sampled have to be representative of their land classes. This means that it is important to take good samples that are not ambiguous and have distinct signatures. Bad samples can affect the classification model greatly. This can be done by taking more smaller, targeted samples, rather than a single large sample (when selecting the regions of interest using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP)). Furthermore, training and test data should not intersect each other, or it could make the accuracy seem higher than it actually is.

Additionally, during the object-based image analysis using Orfeo Toolbox (OTB), the satellite images were segmented using the mean-shift algorithm. While this was a convenient method to segment the images, upon closer analysis the segmentation were not completely accurate, as some parts of roads and buildings could be clustered under the same segment. This could mean that some other clustering algorithm may have suited the image segmentation better. It is important to be aware of these details as we explore new plugins and methods.

#### 8.1.2 Remote Sensing

Overall, the project was a great experience on trying out an actual use case. We have learnt that remote sensing using satellite imagery can be a powerful tool for humanitarian aid, as it can provide rapid and reliable information on the impact of a disaster and support the decision-making and planning of the response.

Learning these skills in the current world can be very beneficial, as remote sensing is becoming more accessible, affordable, and advanced with the development of new technologies, platforms, and data sources. Remote sensing can help us to monitor and understand the changes in the Earth's environment and climate, such as deforestation, glacier melting, and biodiversity loss, and detect and prevent the risks and impacts of natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, floods, droughts, and wildfires.

It can also be used to enhance the security and stability of regions and countries, such as by detecting illegal activities, conflicts, and human rights violations, and improve the quality of life and well-being of people, such as by providing access to information, education, health, and social services.

Remote sensing is a multidisciplinary field that requires the integration of knowledge and skills from various domains, such as geography, geology, statistics, computer science, engineering, and social sciences. Learning these skills can help us to develop our critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and communication abilities, which are essential for the future.

### 8.2 Future Work

Building on the lessons learnt throughout this project experience, the proposed scope of future work is outlined.

1.  Explore other satellite imagery, image segmentation, and classification methods to see if accuracy can be improved.
2.  Explore hydrolysis analysis methods using DEM and QGIS plugins to simulate flood events.
3.  Research into the local context and find out the locations of key infrastructures to prioritise their protection against floods. This understanding is crucial for tailoring recommendations specific to Derna's socio-political circumstances. It will also provide insights into the primary reason behind the severity of the flood: Was it primarily due to human negligence, such as the lapse in dam maintenance since 2002, or natural forces, such as Storm Daniel. Ultimately, this analysis aims to address the question: 'To what extent could this flood have been prevented?'
4.  Examine the impact on Derna's water supply as it is connected to the desalination pipe from the Mediterranean Sea (Naar, 2023) which has become polluted because of the flood, as illustrated in **Section 5.11**.
