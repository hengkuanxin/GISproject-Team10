    "text": "Project Summary\nOur project focuses on a recent devastating flood in Derna, a city in North Africa, that killed thousands of people and damaged many major infrastructures after being hit by Storm Daniel. Our project is motivated by the desire to help the people of Derna recover from the recent flood and to build a more flood-resilient city for the future. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis to measure the effects of the flood on lives and infrastructure, our project proposes (a number of) flood mitigation strategies to minimise damages from future similar incidents.\nThe methods involved include collecting remote sensing data using open-access satellite data hubs, followed by a selection of the various bands of each satellite imagery. We then use Land Use / Land Cover (LULC) classification algorithms to detect LULC changes before and after the flood to observe the effects of the catastrophe on people, such as residential houses and hospitals, as well as important infrastructure, such as arterial roads and cell towers.\nFinally, we identified (a number of) key strategies that policy planners can adopt to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe and, if not, mitigate the damages caused by the recurrence of such heavy storms and floods.\n\n1. Introduction\nOn about September 11, 2023, a heavy storm—Storm Daniel—occurred over the Mediterranean Sea, bringing heavy rains upon the city of Derna, Libya. This caused the collapse of two major dams, ultimately resulting in a devastating flood that killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed homes and many major infrastructures.\n[more information to be inserted, including the background of Derna as well as the cause of the dams’ failure.]\n\n\n2. Motivation\nOur project is motivated by the desire to help the people of Derna recover from the recent flood and build a more resilient city for the future. We believe our analysis will serve as an important insight and tool for Derna’s policymakers to make informed urban planning decisions to identify areas that are at risk of flooding and to develop flood mitigation strategies to prevent and minimise flood damage from any future storms or floods in Derna.\n\n\n3. Objectives\nTo detect land use/land cover changes before and after the Derna flood disaster using remote satellite imagery. To recommend flood mitigation strategies to ease damages from future similar disasters.\n\n\n4.
