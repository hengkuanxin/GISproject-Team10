Recently, the world witnessed Derna, a city situated along the eastern coast of Libya, endure a series of devastating floods causing detrimental humanitarian and infrastructural destruction, exacerbated by the nation’s political-military instability and history of neglect. However, while some may attribute the calamities solely to natural disasters, the devastation is mainly due to neglectful urban planning, inadequate public infrastructure maintenance, and years of political discourse. These incidents have only propelled Libya towards an escalating humanitarian crisis.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Geographic Location of Libya, Derna\n\n\n\n\nDerna, a city renowned as Libya’s cultural capital, has been the subject of with recurrent flood events over the past century, each varying in severity. Located along the eastern coast, this city of approximately 90,000 residents bears the scars of previous floods which occurred in 1941, 1959, and 1968 (Pietromarchi, 2023).\nThe Wadi Derna River, which courses from the south of the city into the Mediterranean Sea, bisects Derna. Control over this river was entrusted to two dams: the Upper Wadi Derna Dam, located 13 kilometers outside the city, with a capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters, and the Lower Wadi Derna Dam, situated a few hundred meters from the city’s outskirts, with a capacity of 22.5 million cubic meters.

In addition, to the loss of life, thousands of residents have been displaced, detrimental damage has been done to homes, and the city has been left without service (Loveluck, 2023).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: GeoEye-1 Satellite Images of Derna Before and After Flood Daniel"

    "text": "2.0     Scope of Work\nThis project is focused on Land Cover Land Use (LULC) change detection using remote sensing techniques. We will be utilising publicly available satellite data such as Sentinel-2 data as well as literature reviews for the analysis of the project. The scope of the project will cover the process of area selection and data collection, data preparation, generating training and testing data, performing Multi-spectral Classification, and finally performing land cover change detection and analyzing the results. For the Multi-spectral Classification of satellite imagery, Supervised Classification technique using the Semi-automatic classification Plugin (SCP) and Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) will be used.\n\n2.1     Datasets\nFor every GIS project, data preparation is a vital step comprising collecting, organizing, and processing geospatial datasets from various sources. The quality of the dataset and the quality of the data wrangling process significantly impact the results of the project. In this Section, we will be discussing the dataset sources and the steps involved in acquiring the data.\n\n2.1.1   Landsat 8-9 Datasets:\nLandsat 8 and Landsat 9 are NASA-operated satellites providing Earth observation data through two instruments: Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). This dataset was obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) EarthExplorer, an open-source platform providing access to a repository of satellite imagery spanning across numerous years and periods. The Landsat 8 datasets comprises 11 bands, each capturing different information about the Earth’s surface, such as visible light, infrared, and thermal data which are vital for tasks such as land cover classification, vegetation analysis, soil monitoring and more (Landsat NASA, 2023).\nThe Landsat 8 datasets used in this project:\n    Landsat Product ID: LC08_L1TP_182037_20230825_20230905_02_T1 = Combined (both OLI and TIRS data).\n   Taken on 2023-09-05T16:55:46Z\n   Band List: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand No. & Type\nBandwidth (µm)\nResolution (m)\n\n\nBand 1 Coastal\n0.43 – 0.45\n30\n\n\nBand 2 Blue\n0.45 – 0.51\n30\n\n\nBand 3 Green\n0.53 – 0.59\n30\n\n\nBand 4 Red\n0.63 – 0.67\n30\n\n\nBand 5 NIR\n0.85 – 0.88\n30\n\n\nBand 6 SWIR 1\n1.57 – 1.65\n30\n\n\nBand 7 SWIR 2\n2.11 – 2.29\n30\n\n\nBand 8 Pan\n0.50 – 0.68\n15\n\n\nBand 9 Cirrus\n1.36 – 1.38\n30\n\n\nBand 10 TIRS 1\n10.6 –  11.19\n30 (100)\n\n\nBand 11 TIRS 2\n11.5 – 12.51\n30 (100)\n\n\n\nTable 1: Landsat 8 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\nThe Landsat 9 datasets used in this project:\n\nLandsat Product ID: LC09_L1TP_182037_20230918_20230918_02_T1 = Combined (both OLI and TIRS data).\n\nTaken on 2023-09-18T14:53:08Z\nBand List: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand No. & Type\nSpectral Range (nm)\n\n\nBand 1—Ultra blue (coastal/aerosol)\n0.435 – 0.451\n\n\nBand 2—Blue\n0.452 – 0.512\n\n\nBand 3—Green\n0.533 – 0.590\n\n\nBand 4—Red\n0.636 – 0.673\n\n\nBand 5—Near infrared (NIR)\n0.851 – 0.879\n\n\nBand 6—Shortwave infrared (SWIR) 1\n1.566 – 1.651\n\n\nBand 7—Shortwave infrared (SWIR) 2\n2.107 – 2.294\n\n\nBand 8—Panchromatic\n0.503 – 0.676\n\n\nBand 9—Cirrus\n1.363 – 1.384\n\n\nBand 10—Thermal infrared (TIR) 1\n10.60 – 11.19\n\n\nBand 11—Thermal infrared (TIR) 2\n11.50 – 12.51\n\n\n\nTable 2: Landsat 8 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\n\n\n2.1.2   Sentinel-2 Datasets:\nSentinel-2 is part of the Copernicus program, an Earth observation initiative by the European Union. Sentinel-2 data was acquired from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. These datasets are divided into three categories based on the spatial resolution:\n\n10m: High-resolution imagery for detailed land use and land cover analysis.\n20m: Moderate-resolution imagery providing a mixture of detail and coverage.\n60m: Low-resolution imagery providing broad coverage with low levels of detail.\n\nIn addition, Sentinel-2 data is categorised into three different processing levels (Level-1C, Level-2A, and Level-2B) to indicate the level of refinement applied to the imagery (European Space Agency n.d.).\nThe processing levels for Sentinel-2 data are:\n\nLevel 1C: Radiometrically corrected data generally used for basic image visualization and analysis.\nLevel 2A: Atmospherically corrected data generally used for LULC detection, vegetation monitoring, and other applications requiring atmospheric effects be removed.\nLevel 2B: Highest level of data processing for scientific research and decision-making processes.\n\nSentinel 2A\n\nProduct URL: S2A_MSIL1C_20230922T090701_N0509_R050_T34SFB_20230922T111044.SAFE\n\nTaken on 2023-09-22T09:07:01.024Z\nProduct Type: S2MSI1C\nProcessing Level: Level 1C\nBand List:\n\n10m: (2, 3, 4, 8)\n20m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B11, B12)\n60m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B9, B11, B12)\n\n\n\nSentinel 2B\n\nProduct URL: S2B_MSIL2A_20230907T090559_N0509_R050_T34SFB_20230907T140740.SAFE\n\nTaken on 2023-09-07T09:05:59.024Z\nProduct Type: S2MSI2A\nProcessing Level: Level 2A\nBand List:\n\n10m: (2, 3, 4, 8)\n20m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B11, B12)\n60m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B9, B11, B12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand No & Type\nCentral Wavelength (µm)\nResolution\n\n\nBand 1 – Costal aerosal\n0.443\n60\n\n\nBand 2 – Blue\n0.490\n10\n\n\nBand 3 – Green\n0.560\n10\n\n\nBand 4 – Red\n0.665\n10\n\n\nBand 5 – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.705\n20\n\n\nBand 6 – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.740\n20\n\n\nBand 7 – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.783\n20\n\n\nBand 8 – Near Infra-red\n0.842\n10\n\n\nBand 8A – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.865\n20\n\n\nBand 9 – Water vapour\n0.945\n60\n\n\nBand 10 – SWIR - Cirrus\n1.375\n60\n\n\nBand 11 – SWIR\n1.610\n20\n\n\nBand 12 – SWIR\n21.90\n20\n\n\n\nTable 3: Sentinel-2 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\n\n\n2.1.3   GeoEye-1 Satellite Imagery:\nThe GeoEye-1 multispectral satellite imagery has been sourced from Maxar, a company providing satellite products. As part of their Open Data Program, Maxar releases open data for select major crisis events for humanitarian purposes (Maxar, n.d.).\nGeoEye-1 imagery offers high-resolution panchromatic and multispectral imagery at 0.50 and 1.84 meters, respectively (European Space Agency, 2022). However, the imagery obtained from Maxar only covered a limited geographic area. Therefore, the team had to merge multiple raster layers to create a comprehensive raster image layer of Derna, Libya.\nQuadKey Numbers (for both 2023-07-01 and 2023-09-13):\n\n120200213132\n120200213123\n120200213131\n120200213121\n120200213133\n120200213130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand Type\nSpectral Range (nm)\n\n\nPanchromatic**\n450 – 800\n\n\nBlue\n450 – 510\n\n\nGreen\n510 – 580\n\n\nRed\n655 – 69\n\n\nNear Ifra-Red\n780 – 920\n\n\n\nTable 4: GeoEye-1 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\n**Note: This band was not used in LULC detection\n\n\n2.1.4   Digital Elevation Model (DEM):\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) dataset was obtained from the USGS EarthExplorer. It is a 30-meter digital elevation model data with a spatial resolution of about 30 meters and an absolute vertical height accuracy of less than 16 meters (GIS Geography, 2023).\n\n\n2.1.5   FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) collaborated together to prepare a Soil Map of the World at 1:5,000,000 scale. The project was completed in 1981 and was a global collaboration between numerous soil scientists. To date, it is the only global overview of soil resources.\n\n\n\n2.2     Project Schedule\nThe project schedule is detailed in Figure 5. To ensure the distribution of workload was fair, the tasks were split according to their complexity as well as their respective week.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Project Schedule Gantt Chart"

For example, the Landsat 8, Landsat 9, and Sentinel-2 raster layers encompass a large area which extends beyond the boundaries of Derna, our focal area. Conversely, the Maxar raster layers require merging to cover the entirety of Derna. Therefore, processing the raster layers is a crucial preliminary step as it sets the foundation for a reliable and targeted dataset essential for effective SCP classification of Derna.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Layer &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Raster Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the  icon.\nNavigate to the Sentinel-2B, 7/09/2023 folder in your computer’s repository.\nFrom Sentinel-2B, 7/09/2023 &gt; GRANULE &gt; L2A_T34SFB_A033967_20230907T091849 &gt; IMG_DATA &gt; 10m &gt; Select B02-B08_10m.jp2 layers and click on open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the  button to add the raster layers\n\nThe layers will be added into the Layers panel\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Clip Raster Layers\n\nFrom Raster &gt; Extraction &gt; Clip Raster by Mask Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Input Layer put T34SFB_20230907T090559_B02_10m layer\nFor Clipping extent select Calculate from Layer and put the Derna_city_250m_hexagon layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Run\nA new virtual layer called Clipped (extent) will be added into the layers panel.

Fe is essential for healthy vegetation as it plays an essential role in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen-fixation as nitrogen-fixing bacteria use it for enzymatic reactions (The Fertilizer Institute, n.d.).\nFe2+/Fe3+ deficiency can cause a variety of problems for vegetation such as stunted growth, wilting and reduced yields (The Fertilizer Institute, n.d.).\nFe3+ is calculated as a ratio of Red(R) and Green (G) values as per the following equation:\nFe3+=R/G\nWhere:\nRed – Band 3\nGreen – Band 2\n\nRepeat the steps from Section 4.1.3 however under ‘Expression’ input:\n\n(\"01-07-2023 Merged@3\"/\"01-07-2023 Merged@2\")\n\nAdjust the Symbology according to the following:\n\n\nSet Render type to Singleband pseudocolor\nColor Ramp: Cividis\nMode: Equal Interval\nClasses: 4\n\nYou will get the following layer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExport the Output layer as a GeoTiff called Ferric Iron, Fe3+ and save it in the 01-07-2023 Clipped folder.\n\nRepeat the steps from Sections 4.1.1 – 4.1.4 for the 13-09-2023 Merged raster layer.

Data Exploration of Composite Images\n\n5.1 Composite Images\nPrior to conducting the Land Use Land Cover Change (LULC) classification, it is vital that the composite images are examined to gain a better understanding of the land cover changes caused by the flood. This understanding will enable visual identification of errors without constantly needing to meticulously examine the quantifiable metrics.\n\n5.1.1 Natural Color Images\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-2 & GeoEye-1 Natural Color Images Before and After the Flood\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: GeoEye-1 Natural Color Images of the Flood Damage\n\n\nThe pre-flood images in Figure 7, demonstrate that Derna is a coastal city bisected by a river, the Wadi Derna River, comprising dense patches of vegetation and a mountainous terrain. However, the post-flood photos in Figure 7 illustrate a scene of utter chaos and destruction as despite the floodwaters notably receding, it is evident that they are carrying a substantial amount of mud and debris, discernible through the color of the water. In addition, tremendous damage has been caused to Derna’s essential infrastructure through the destruction of five major roads, a highway, and a port facility as depicted in Figure 8. In particular, the city center has been inundated with areas in close proximity to the Wadi Derna River appearing to have experienced the brunt of the devastation.\nIn addition, the visualisation of the damage is far easier to see in the GeoEye-1 imagery, followed by Sentinel-2 imagery, and lastly the Landsat 8/9 imagery. This can be attributed to GeoEye-1’s close proximity (1.84m) to the target site, resulting in a higher image resolution.\n\n\n5.1.2 False Color Composite Images\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-2 & GeoEye-1 False Color Composite Images Before and After the Flood\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: GeoEye-1 False Color Composite Images of the Flood Damage\n\n\nThe pre-flood images in Figures 9 and 10, depicts dense vegetation alongside the Wadi Derna river, with dense patches of farmlands scattered throughout the city of Derna. In addition, sparse variation can be observed throughout the city. However, the post-flood photos in Figures 9 and 10 illustrate a severe reduction of vegetation with a notable decrease in vegetation density alongside the Wadi Derna river with numerous plantations in the city being transformed into barren land after the flood.\n\n\n5.1.3 Geology Images\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Landsat 8/9 & Sentinel-2 Geology Images Before and After the Flood\n\n\nThe pre-flood geological features of Derna in Figure 11 depicts a dense concentration of geological structures located away from the urban area, which is located along the coastline. The mountainous terrain exhibits a variety of geological characteristics, which is illustrated by the varying intensity of the yellow color. The post-flood images exhibit a more well-defined geological structure, indicating that the flood may have exposed underlying formations through erosion enabled by natural processes such as chemical weathering1.\n1Chemical weathering refers to the chemical decomposition of rocks in situ by natural agents at the earth's surface which causes rocks to be weakened and land to be made more permeable, making it more susceptible to erosion.\n\n\n5.1.4 Moisture Index Images\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Landsat 8/9 & Sentinel-2 Geology Images Before and After the Flood\n\n\nThe pre-flood Moisture Index in Figure 12 exhibits a relatively high water uptake in areas of dense vegetation which reveals that these regions were well-hydrated prior to the flood. However, the post-flood imagery illustrates a slightly increased water uptake in these regions, which indicates that the flood further saturated these regions.\n\n\n5.1.5 NDVI/GNDVI\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-2 & GeoEye-1 GNDVI Before and After the Flood\n\n\nThe pre-flood GNDVI/NDVI illustrates good vegetation density and health. However, the post-flood GNDVI/NDVI indicates a severe reduction of vegetation, however, vegetation health remains mostly unchanged.\n\n\n5.1.6 RDVI\n\n\n\nFigure 14: GeoEye-1 RDVI Images Before and After the Flood\n\n\nThe pre-flood RDVI in Figure 14 illustrates good vegetation health and dense vegetation is distributed across the city. However, the post-flood RDVI demonstrates a severe reduction in vegetation density and decline in vegetation health as illustrated by the white spots present. This indicates that the flood not only stripped away vegetation but also attributed towards reducing vegetation health.\nNow that we have gained a better understanding of the land cover changes from Sections 5.1.1 – 5.1.6, we are now ready to proceed with the Land Cover Classification, as outlined in Section 5.2.\n\n\n\n5.2 Land Cover Classification (GeoEye-1)\n\n5.2.1 Land Cover Scheme\nWe will classify the land cover based on the following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaterbody: sea, coastal water\nBareland: Open land, rock\nVegetation: Farmland, Natural Vegetation\nBuilt-up: Buildings, Residentials, Factories\nImpervious Surface: Roads, Concrete\nCloud\nShadow\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Selecting Training & Test Sets (Before Flood)\nWe will now create 2 sets of samples to be used to train and test our classification model. As the classification will require creating many ESRI shapefile files, we must ensure we practice good file management.\n\nCreate a folder called LULC.\nWithin LULC, create a sub-folder called shapefile.\nInside shapefile create 3 sub-folders called before_flood, after_flood, and classification.\n\nNote: it is very important that our folders’ names do not contain any spaces; if you have any space in your folders’ names, replace it with an underscore.\n\nReturn to QGIS. From Layer &gt; Create Layer &gt; select New Shapefile Layer…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: save the new file under shapefile &gt; before_flood as sample_before.\n\nOnce done, click on OK and the new layer will be added to our project.\nSelect on the layer and click on toggle editing, then click on the tool called Add Point Feature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now create a sample point on our map, referencing the multi-spectral composite layers before the flood, 01-07-2023 we created earlier, such as the False Color Composite.\n\nClick on the following red point on the map and fill in the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis signifies that we have created a sample point at that location and given it a land cover class 1, referring to that of a waterbody in our land cover scheme.\n\nRepeat this step until we get a total of 50 sample points for each land cover class. Since there are no clouds and shadows present before the flood, we can skip them for now.\n\nYou should have a total of 250 sample points representing a total of 5 different land cover classes, as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we continue, repeat the steps to create another vector layer called test_before, and create a total of 250 test points, while ensuring that our test points do not overlap with the sample points, as shown below (in green):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Image Segmentation (Before Flood)\nNow, we will segment the image using a clustering algorithm called “mean shift” to automatically identify objects present in the image.\n\nClick on the processing toolbox, and open the function called “Segmentation”, and fill in the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down and ensure we check the checkbox “8-neighbor connectivity”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect output file and save it as a shapefile segmentation_before.shp under the folder shapefile &gt; before_flood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave all other options as their default values and click on run. This program might take a few minutes.\n\nOnce done, a the following vector layer will be added to the layers panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, open the processing tool called ZonalStatistics, and fill in the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you save the output file into the same folder, calling it segmentation_stats_before.shp. Click on Run.\n\nOnce done, we get a new layer as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the attribute table of this layer, and we observe 4 sets of statistics, calculated from the 4 bands present in our GeoEye-1 data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now use our sample set to select the segments (objects). Open the processing tool called Join attributes by location and fill in the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the output file as a shapefile called sample_stats_before.shp saved under the folder shapefile&gt; before_flood. Click on Run.\n\nOnce done, we get a layer as follows, note that the sample points we created before are now covered by small segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat this step with the test samples, using test_before as the input file, and save the output as test_stats_before.shp under the folder shapefile&gt; before_flood. Click on Run.\n\nYou will get the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Model Training (Before Flood)\nWe will now train the classification model.\n\nOpen the tool called TrainVectorClassifier and fill in the details as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the output file as OBIA_model_before.model under the file shapefile &gt; classification.\nOnce done, click on Run. We do not get a new layer output this time.\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Classification (Before Flood)\n\nAfter that, open the tool called VectorClassifier and fill in the details as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the output file as SVM_classification_output_before.shp under the folder shapefiles &gt; classification. Once done, click on Run.\n\nThe output file is not automatically added to our project this time.\n\nNavigate to the classification output file and import it into our project. We get a layer as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to properties of this layer, and select the options as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorised by the predicted value, there will be 5 different classes representing the land cover types defined earlier.\n\nClick on Apply, and you should get something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore continuing we must first dissolve the vector output so that all segments are grouped together by the land cover class. Select the vector tool and fill in the details as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the output file as a GeoPackage, and name it SVM_classification_output_before_dissolved. Once done, click on Run.\n\nWe get a new layer as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the steps and adjust the properties of the layer to get the following results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will rasterize the layer. Open the tool Rasterize and fill in the details as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the output file as TIF file, under the folder GeoEye-1 &gt; 1-07-2023 Clipped as SVM_classification_before.tif. Click on Run.\n\nYou will get the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the above steps to manipulate the properties of this layer.\n\nYou will get the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.6 Accuracy Assessment (Before Flood)\nFinally, we will use the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) tool to calculate the accuracy of the classification.\n\nFrom SCP &gt; Postprocessing &gt; select Accuracy, and fill in the details as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Run. A dialog window pops up. Save the file as SVM_classification_accuracy_before.tif under the folder shapefile &gt; classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, the program takes a few seconds to run and gives us the following output.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above result provides the area-based error matrix, as well as the overall accuracy and kappa hat value.\n\n\n5.2.7 Repeat the steps for another classification (After Flood)\nRepeat the processes in Sections 5.2.2 – 5.2.7, using the files from 13-09-2023 Clipped to classify the satellite image taken after the flood. Save the files into shapefile &gt; after_flood and classification.\nYou will get the following results:\n\n\n\nTest and Training Samples\n\n\n\n\n\nSegmentation\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nRasterized Classification\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy Assessment\n\n\n\n\n5.2.8 Land Cover Change Detection\nFinally, we will use the SCP tool to create a raster layer highlighting the changes in land cover classes before and after the flood.\n\nFrom SCP &gt; Postprocessing &gt; select Land cover change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the details as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce ready, click on Run. Save the output file under shapefile &gt; classification, as SVM_LULC_change.tif. After a few seconds, the execution is complete, and we see a new raster layer added to our project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust the properties of the new layer as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Apply.\n\nWe have now highlighted the extent of damages of the flood caused to different land cover classes, as shown below:\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Highlighted Damages (in Area)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Land Cover Classification (Sentinel-2)\n\n5.3.1 Selecting Regions of Interest for Training (Before Flood)\nIn this section, we will be creating a few other files separately. For good file management,\n\nCreate a folder called SCP in the LULC folder.\nNext, create two sub-folders called before_flood_sentinel and after_flood_sentinel inside the SCP folder.\n\nWe will now classify the Sentinel-2 satellite images using the SCP Plugin.\nEnsure you have the following layers present in your project:\n\nT34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B2_10m\nT34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B3_10m\nT34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B4_10m\nT34SFB_07-09-2023_T090559_B8_10m\n\n\nOpen the SCP tool, and set these four bands into a new Band set, and set the wavelength quick settings as “Sentinel-2”, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, set the following four bands into Band set 1.\n\nNext, close the dialog window, and navigate to the SCP & Dock panel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Training Input along the side of the panel, and click on the icon with a yellow circle to create a new training input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA dialog window pops up. Save the file as train_before.scp under the folder before_flood_sentinel, as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, following our land cover scheme earlier, we will create a region of interest (ROI) representing the land cover of a waterbody.\n\nFill in the MC Name and C Name, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, click on the following tool called Create a ROI polygon inside the SCP toolbar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will create a polygon in the waterbody, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, click on the following icon to save the ROI’s signature. This process will take a few seconds to execute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, a saved signature appears in our signature list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the previous steps for a total of 5 samples for each land cover class for a total of 5 different land cover classes, as shown in our land cover scheme. You should set the MC ID to each match the land cover class.\n\nWaterbody will use 1 as the MCID, Bareland 2, Vegetation 3, and so on, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there are no clouds or shadows in the Sentinel-2 images. Therefore we will not include those classes.\nOnce complete, there will a total of 25 ROI, representing 5 different land cover classes, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Maximum Likelihood Classification (Before Flood)\nNext, we will be classifying our satellite image using the calculated signatures of the ROIs that we have created.\n\nFrom SCP &gt; Band processing &gt; select Classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, click on Run and save the output file as ML_before_flood under the folder before_flood_sentinel. The process will take a few seconds to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the process is complete, close the SCP window.\n\nYou will get the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust the properties of this new layer using the methods used earlier, such that the result looks like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Maximum Likelihood gave us a more accurate result in this case, therefore it is preferred over the other methods.\n\n\n5.3.3 Selecting Regions of Interest for Testing (Before Flood)\nWe will repeat the previous section and create a set of ROIs to test our classification using the same band set. In our case, we are using band set 1.\n\nSame as before, create a new file called test_before.scp under the folder before_flood_sentinel.\nCreate a total of 25 ROIs, representing the 5 land cover classes.\n\nYou will get the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Accuracy Assessment (Before Flood)\nOnce we have completed our classification, we will now assess the accuracy to determine whether the classification is reliable and can be used to detect land cover change.\n\nFrom SCP &gt; Postprocessing &gt; select Accuracy, as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the details as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, click on Run, and save your output file as ML_accuracy_before_flood under the folder before_flood_sentinel as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon completion, the program will execute.\n\nYou will receive the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the result, we are able to see the area-based error matrix, as well as the overall accuracy and kappa hat value of the classification.\n\n\n5.3.5 Maximum Likelihood Classification (After Flood)\nRepeat the steps above to classify the Sentinel-2 satellite images taken after the flood.\nEnsure you have the following layers in your project:\n\nT34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B2_10m\nT34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B3_10m\nT34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B4_10m\nT34SFB_18-09-2023_T090559_B8_10m\n\n\nNext, add them into a new band set, for example, Band set 2.\nCreate the ROIs for Train and Test, naming the files as train_after.scp and test_after.scp respectively, saving them into the folder after_flood_sentinel.\nPerform maximum likelihood classification, saving your file as ML_after_flood under the folder after_flood_sentinel.\nAssess the accuracy of the classification.\n\n\n\n5.3.6 Land Cover Change Detection\nOnce the two classifications are ready, we will use the SCP tool to determine the changes before and after the flood.\n\nSelect the Land cover change tool of the SCP plugin (as shown in previous sections) and fill in the details as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Run and save the output as ML_LULC_sentinel under the folder SCP. The output is shown as follows, with a new layer added to our project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame as what we did before during the classification of GeoEye-1 images, adjust the properties of the new layer such that it appears as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Land Cover Classification (Landsat 8/9)\nRepeat the steps in Section 5.3 for the classification of the Landsat 8/9 satellite images before and after the flood.\n\nCreate 2 new sub-folders called before_flood_landsat and after_flood_landsat under the folder SCP.\nEnsure that you have the following layers in your project:\n\n\nLC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B1\nLC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B2\nLC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B3\nLC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B4\nLC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B5\nLC08_L1TP_182037_2023-08-25_T1_B6\n\n\nNext, add the layers into a new band set, such as Band set 3.\nCreate the ROIs for Train and Test, naming the files as train_before.scp and test_before.scp respectively, saving them into the folder before_flood_landsat.\nPerform random forest classification, saving your file as RF_before_flood under the folder before_flood_landsat.\n\nNote: As Random Forest provided a more accurate result for this scenario, it is preferred over the other methods.\n\nAssess the accuracy of the classification.\n\nOnce the classification for the Landsat 8 images before the flood is complete, repeat the steps for the classification for the Landsat 9 images after the flood, using the following layers:\n\nLC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B1\nLC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B2\nLC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B3\nLC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B4\nLC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B5\nLC09_L1TP_182037_2023-09-18_T1_B6\n\nThe results of the classification are shown below:\n\n\n\nClassification Before Flood (Landsat)\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification After Flood (Landsat)\n\n\nAs the resolution of the Landsat 8/9 satellite images are too coarse to clearly identify some land covers such as the roads (Impervious Surface), which are narrow and long, it indicates that classifications using Landsat 8/9 satellite images are not as useful as other satellite imagery to detect land cover changes. Therefore, we will be omitting the Landsat 8/9 satellite images from our final analysis."

    "text": "2.0     Scope of Work\nThis project is focused on Land Cover Land Use (LULC) change detection using remote sensing techniques. We will be utilising publicly available satellite data such as Sentinel-2 data as well as literature reviews for the analysis of the project. The scope of the project will cover the process of area selection and data collection, data preparation, generating training and testing data, performing Multi-spectral Classification, and finally performing land cover change detection and analyzing the results. For the Multi-spectral Classification of satellite imagery, Supervised Classification technique using the Semi-automatic classification Plugin (SCP) and Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) will be used.\n\n2.1     Datasets\nFor every GIS project, data preparation is a vital step comprising collecting, organizing, and processing geospatial datasets from various sources. The quality of the dataset and the quality of the data wrangling process significantly impact the results of the project. In this Section, we will be discussing the dataset sources and the steps involved in acquiring the data.\n\n2.1.1   Landsat 8-9 Datasets:\nLandsat 8 and Landsat 9 are NASA-operated satellites providing Earth observation data through two instruments: Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). This dataset was obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) EarthExplorer, an open-source platform providing access to a repository of satellite imagery spanning across numerous years and periods. The Landsat 8 datasets comprises 11 bands, each capturing different information about the Earth’s surface, such as visible light, infrared, and thermal data which are vital for tasks such as land cover classification, vegetation analysis, soil monitoring and more (Landsat NASA, 2023).\nThe Landsat 8 datasets used in this project:\n    Landsat Product ID: LC08_L1TP_182037_20230825_20230905_02_T1 = Combined (both OLI and TIRS data).\n   Taken on 2023-09-05T16:55:46Z\n   Band List: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand No. & Type\nBandwidth (µm)\nResolution (m)\n\n\nBand 1 Coastal\n0.43 – 0.45\n30\n\n\nBand 2 Blue\n0.45 – 0.51\n30\n\n\nBand 3 Green\n0.53 – 0.59\n30\n\n\nBand 4 Red\n0.63 – 0.67\n30\n\n\nBand 5 NIR\n0.85 – 0.88\n30\n\n\nBand 6 SWIR 1\n1.57 – 1.65\n30\n\n\nBand 7 SWIR 2\n2.11 – 2.29\n30\n\n\nBand 8 Pan\n0.50 – 0.68\n15\n\n\nBand 9 Cirrus\n1.36 – 1.38\n30\n\n\nBand 10 TIRS 1\n10.6 –  11.19\n30 (100)\n\n\nBand 11 TIRS 2\n11.5 – 12.51\n30 (100)\n\n\n\nTable 1: Landsat 8 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\nThe Landsat 9 datasets used in this project:\n\nLandsat Product ID: LC09_L1TP_182037_20230918_20230918_02_T1 = Combined (both OLI and TIRS data).\n\nTaken on 2023-09-18T14:53:08Z\nBand List: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand No. & Type\nSpectral Range (nm)\n\n\nBand 1—Ultra blue (coastal/aerosol)\n0.435 – 0.451\n\n\nBand 2—Blue\n0.452 – 0.512\n\n\nBand 3—Green\n0.533 – 0.590\n\n\nBand 4—Red\n0.636 – 0.673\n\n\nBand 5—Near infrared (NIR)\n0.851 – 0.879\n\n\nBand 6—Shortwave infrared (SWIR) 1\n1.566 – 1.651\n\n\nBand 7—Shortwave infrared (SWIR) 2\n2.107 – 2.294\n\n\nBand 8—Panchromatic\n0.503 – 0.676\n\n\nBand 9—Cirrus\n1.363 – 1.384\n\n\nBand 10—Thermal infrared (TIR) 1\n10.60 – 11.19\n\n\nBand 11—Thermal infrared (TIR) 2\n11.50 – 12.51\n\n\n\nTable 2: Landsat 8 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\n\n\n2.1.2   Sentinel-2 Datasets:\nSentinel-2 is part of the Copernicus program, an Earth observation initiative by the European Union. Sentinel-2 data was acquired from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. These datasets are divided into three categories based on the spatial resolution:\n\n10m: High-resolution imagery for detailed land use and land cover analysis.\n20m: Moderate-resolution imagery providing a mixture of detail and coverage.\n60m: Low-resolution imagery providing broad coverage with low levels of detail.\n\nIn addition, Sentinel-2 data is categorised into three different processing levels (Level-1C, Level-2A, and Level-2B) to indicate the level of refinement applied to the imagery (European Space Agency n.d.).\nThe processing levels for Sentinel-2 data are:\n\nLevel 1C: Radiometrically corrected data generally used for basic image visualization and analysis.\nLevel 2A: Atmospherically corrected data generally used for LULC detection, vegetation monitoring, and other applications requiring atmospheric effects be removed.\nLevel 2B: Highest level of data processing for scientific research and decision-making processes.\n\nSentinel 2A\n\nProduct URL: S2A_MSIL1C_20230922T090701_N0509_R050_T34SFB_20230922T111044.SAFE\n\nTaken on 2023-09-22T09:07:01.024Z\nProduct Type: S2MSI1C\nProcessing Level: Level 1C\nBand List:\n\n10m: (2, 3, 4, 8)\n20m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B11, B12)\n60m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B9, B11, B12)\n\n\n\nSentinel 2B\n\nProduct URL: S2B_MSIL2A_20230907T090559_N0509_R050_T34SFB_20230907T140740.SAFE\n\nTaken on 2023-09-07T09:05:59.024Z\nProduct Type: S2MSI2A\nProcessing Level: Level 2A\nBand List:\n\n10m: (2, 3, 4, 8)\n20m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B11, B12)\n60m: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, B9, B11, B12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand No & Type\nCentral Wavelength (µm)\nResolution\n\n\nBand 1 – Costal aerosal\n0.443\n60\n\n\nBand 2 – Blue\n0.490\n10\n\n\nBand 3 – Green\n0.560\n10\n\n\nBand 4 – Red\n0.665\n10\n\n\nBand 5 – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.705\n20\n\n\nBand 6 – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.740\n20\n\n\nBand 7 – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.783\n20\n\n\nBand 8 – Near Infra-red\n0.842\n10\n\n\nBand 8A – Vegetation Red Edge\n0.865\n20\n\n\nBand 9 – Water vapour\n0.945\n60\n\n\nBand 10 – SWIR - Cirrus\n1.375\n60\n\n\nBand 11 – SWIR\n1.610\n20\n\n\nBand 12 – SWIR\n21.90\n20\n\n\n\nTable 3: Sentinel-2 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\n\n\n2.1.3   GeoEye-1 Satellite Imagery:\nThe GeoEye-1 multispectral satellite imagery has been sourced from Maxar, a company providing satellite products. As part of their Open Data Program, Maxar releases open data for select major crisis events for humanitarian purposes (Maxar, n.d.).\nGeoEye-1 imagery offers high-resolution panchromatic and multispectral imagery at 0.50 and 1.84 meters, respectively (European Space Agency, 2022). However, the imagery obtained from Maxar only covered a limited geographic area. Therefore, the team had to merge multiple raster layers to create a comprehensive raster image layer of Derna, Libya.\nQuadKey Numbers (for both 2023-07-01 and 2023-09-13):\n\n120200213132\n120200213123\n120200213131\n120200213121\n120200213133\n120200213130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand Type\nSpectral Range (nm)\n\n\nPanchromatic**\n450 – 800\n\n\nBlue\n450 – 510\n\n\nGreen\n510 – 580\n\n\nRed\n655 – 69\n\n\nNear Ifra-Red\n780 – 920\n\n\n\nTable 4: GeoEye-1 Spectral Bands Description (Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.)\n**Note: This band was not used in LULC detection\n\n\n2.1.4   Digital Elevation Model (DEM):\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) dataset was obtained from the USGS EarthExplorer. It is a 30-meter digital elevation model data with a spatial resolution of about 30 meters and an absolute vertical height accuracy of less than 16 meters (GIS Geography, 2023).\n\n\n2.1.5   FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) collaborated together to prepare a Soil Map of the World at 1:5,000,000 scale. The project was completed in 1981 and was a global collaboration between numerous soil scientists. To date, it is the only global overview of soil resources.\n\n\n\n2.2     Project Schedule\nThe project schedule is detailed in Figure 5. To ensure the distribution of workload was fair, the tasks were split according to their complexity as well as their respective week.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Project Schedule Gantt Chart"

    "text": "Classification\nIt was very important that we understand the processes behind the different supervised classification methods, else it could affect the accuracy and findings greatly. In order to improve the classification accuracy, the training and test data sampled have to be representative of their land classes. This means that it is important to take good samples that are not ambiguous and have distinct signatures. Bad samples can affect the classification model greatly. This can be done by taking more smaller, targeted samples, rather than a single large sample (when selecting the regions of interest using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP).) Furthermore, training and test data must not intersect each other, or it could make the accuracy seem higher than it actually is.\nAdditionally, during the object-based image analysis using Orfeo Toolbox (OTB), the satellite images were segmented using the mean-shift algorithm. While this was a convenient method to segment the images, upon closer analysis the segmentation were not completely accurate, as some parts of roads and buildings could be clustered under the same segment. This could mean that some other clustering algorithm may have suited the image segmentation better. It is important to be aware of these details as we explore new plugins and methods.\nRemote Sensing\nOverall, the project was a great experience on trying out an actual use case. We have learnt that remote sensing using satellite imagery can be a powerful tool for humanitarian aid, as it can provide rapid and reliable information on the impact of a disaster and support the decision-making and planning of the response.\nLearning these skills in the current world can be very beneficial, as remote sensing is becoming more accessible, affordable, and advanced with the development of new technologies, platforms, and data sources. Remote sensing can help us to monitor and understand the changes in the Earth’s environment and climate, such as deforestation, glacier melting, and biodiversity loss, and detect and prevent the risks and impacts of natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, floods, droughts, and wildfires.\nIt can also be used to enhance the security and stability of regions and countries, such as by detecting illegal activities, conflicts, and human rights violations, and improve the quality of life and well-being of people, such as by providing access to information, education, health, and social services.\nRemote sensing is a multidisciplinary field that requires the integration of knowledge and skills from various domains, such as geography, geology, physics, mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, and social sciences. Learning these skills can help us to develop our critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and communication abilities, which are essential for the future."
