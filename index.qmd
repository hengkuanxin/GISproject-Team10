# FloodScape: Unearthing Resilience

## Project and Team Background

This project is an undergraduate assignment in the GIS for Urban Planning module taught by Dr. Kam Tin Seong, Associate Professor of Information Systems (Practice) at Singapore Management University.

**Theme 1**: Urban Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Change Detection for Flood Mapping Applications of Satellite Remote Sensing

**Team name:** G1 Team 10

**Team members:**

## Project Summary
Our project focuses on a recent devastating flood in Derna, a city in North Africa, that killed thousands of people and damaged many major infrastructures after being hit by Storm Daniel. Our project is motivated by the desire to help the people of Derna recover from the recent flood and to build a more flood-resilient city for the future. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis to measure the effects of the flood on lives and infrastructure, our project proposes (a number of) flood mitigation strategies to minimise damages from future similar incidents.

The methods involved include collecting remote sensing data using open-access satellite data hubs, followed by a selection of the various bands of each satellite imagery. We then use Land Use / Land Cover (LULC) classification algorithms to detect LULC changes before and after the flood to observe the effects of the catastrophe on people, such as residential houses and hospitals, as well as important infrastructure, such as arterial roads and cell towers. 

Finally, we identified (a number of) key strategies that policy planners can adopt to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe and, if not, mitigate the damages caused by the recurrence of such heavy storms and floods.
